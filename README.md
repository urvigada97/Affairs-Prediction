# Affairs-Prediction
I decided to treat this as a classification problem by creating a new binary  variable affair (did the woman have at least one affair?) and trying to  predict the classification for each woman. <br/>
Dataset: <br/>
The dataset I chose is the affairs dataset that comes with Statsmodels. It  was derived from a survey of women in 1974 by Redbook magazine, in  which married women were asked about their participation in extramarital  affairs. More information about the study is available in a 1978 paper from  the Journal of Political Economy. <br/>
Description of Variables: <br/>
The dataset contains 6366 observations of 9 variables: <br/>
1. rate_marriage: woman's rating of her marriage (1 = very poor, 5 =  very good) 
2. age: woman's age 
3. yrs_married: number of years married 
4. children: number of children 
5. religious: woman's rating of how religious she is (1 = not religious, 4 =  strongly religious) 
6. educ: level of education (9 = grade school, 12 = high school, 14 =  some college, 16 = college graduate, 17 = some graduate school, 20  = advanced degree)
7. occupation: woman's occupation (1 = student, 2 = farming/semi skilled/unskilled, 3 = "white collar", 4 = teacher/nurse/writer/technician/skilled, 5 = managerial/business, 6 =  professional with advanced degree) 
8. occupation_husb: husband's occupation (same coding as above) 
9. affairs: time spent in extra-marital affairs
